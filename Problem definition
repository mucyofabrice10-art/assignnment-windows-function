Step 1: Problem Definition
Business Context

A mid-sized retail company operates multiple stores across different regions and sells a variety of product categories to a diverse customer base. The sales and marketing department is responsible for monitoring performance, understanding customer purchasing behavior, and planning promotions.

Data Challenge

Management currently lacks a clear view of which products perform best in each region, how revenue changes from month to month, and which customers contribute the most to overall sales. The existing reports are mostly static and do not provide detailed analytical comparisons across time or customer segments.

Expected Outcome

The analysis is expected to identify top-performing products by region, reveal monthly revenue trends, and segment customers based on spending levels so that marketing strategies, inventory planning, and promotional campaigns can be improved.
